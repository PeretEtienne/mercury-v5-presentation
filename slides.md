# |- Why ?

  ⚙️ Mercury has not been created with customisation in mind

  🙃 With each new features the soft is harder to maintain

  👓 Responsabilities between front and back are uncleared

  👶 The front stack (Twig/jQuery) is a bit weak for complex UI

  ⚠️ API endpoints does not respect any REST conventions 

  ⏳ Mercury does not bring great UX with long loading times, infinite tab opening, no direct links, etc...
